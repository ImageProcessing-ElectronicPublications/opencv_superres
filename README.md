### TensorFlow [EDSR](https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow)

TensorFlow implementation of [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf)[1].

It was trained on the [Div2K dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) - Train Data (HR images).

### TensorFlow [ESPCN](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN)

Tensorflow implementation of ESPCN algorithm described in [1].
This project was done during the Google Summer of Code 2019 program with OpenCV [2].

### TensorFlow [FSRCNN](https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow)

TensorFlow implementation of [Accelerating the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/FSRCNN.html) [1].

This implementation replaces the transpose conv2d layer by a sub-pixel layer [2]. 

Includes pretrained models for scales x2, x3 and x4. Which were trained on T91-image dataset, and finetuned on General100 dataset.

FSRCNN-small is a network with fewer parameters. Thus it is faster but has lower performance.

### TensorFlow [LapSRN](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LapSRN)

Tensorflow implementation of LapSRN algorithm described in [1]. It can now support training for 2x, 4x, and 8x scaling factor.
